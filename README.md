The objective of this repository is to create modules for MicroPython using Object-Oriented Programming. This approach allows the same program to drive different peripherals. For example, you can use the same command to draw on an OLED display or in Tkinter.

The following files contain applications that you can execute after downloading or cloning the entire project
* billar_micropython.py                             
* billar_tkinter.py                                                                          
* line_follower_tkinter.py                                             
* line_fol_perc_tkinter.py                                             
* line_fol_reinf_tkinter .py                                           
                                             

The 'img' directory contains some images and utilities to convert images to matrix format.

The files in the 'py' subdirectory cannot be executed in MicroPython.
The files in the 'upy' subdirectory cannot be executed on a computer.
