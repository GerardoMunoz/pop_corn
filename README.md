The objective of this repository is to create modules for MicroPython using Object-Oriented Programming. This approach allows the same program to drive different peripherals. For example, you can use the same command to draw on an OLED display or in Tkinter.

The py subdirectory runs on a PC, while the upy subdirectory runs on a microcontroller. The idea is for both directories to use the same main program but different drivers.
