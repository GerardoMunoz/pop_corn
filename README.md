The objective of this repository is to create modules for MicroPython using Object-Oriented Programming. This approach allows the same program to drive different peripherals. For example, you can use the same command to draw on an OLED display or in Tkinter.

The billar_py directory runs on a PC, while the billar_upy directory runs on a microcontroller. The idea is for both directories to have the same main program but use different drivers.
